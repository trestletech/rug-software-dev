Revision Control Motivation
===========================

### "This function used to work!"
<span class="indent">Inspect provenance of any file in your project.</span>

### "Please send me the code you used here."
<span class="indent">Might be some publication from years ago.</span>

### "I found a bug in your code and fixed it."

Revision Control
================

- Track changes to a set of files ("commits") over time with custom granularity
- Record messages alongside each commit to record what you did
- Revert any file -- or the whole set -- back to any point in the project's history 
- Maintain multiple versions ("branches") in parallel in one location ("repository")
- Collaborate by contributing your changes ("commits") to a central server.

Why Git?
========

Git is a modern, distributed revision control system.

- "Modern"
  - Learned from past implementations
  - Better branching and merging
- "[Distributed](http://hginit.com/00.html)"
  - Commit, refine, clean locally before sharing with others
  - Multi-authority -- changes to code can come from multiple sources
  - Always nice to have a copy in your control

GitHub
======

- Typically want an authoritative copy of your Git repository somewhere.
- GitHub hosts (and backs up) Git repositories for you.
- Also provides a web interface with a litany of incredible features.
  - Compare different copies of your code
  - User-friendly "diff"s
  - Team-based access management to your projects
  - Free hosting for open-source



GitHub Definitions
==================

- **Fork** -- To clone a copy of someone else's repository into your own. May not have write permissions on the original repository, do have them on your copy.
- **Pull Request** -- To submit changes you've made in your fork of a project back to the original project. How GitHub enables contributions to open-source projects.
